The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [√] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [√] In this app you can turn on dark mode to change the UI and there is a party size caclulator to split the tip amongst your group.

## Notes

Some challanges I faced when making this app was getting used to the new swift syntax and xcode interface. At the beginning, it can be pretty daunting making any of the bonus features. But as time went on, I managed to implement some extra features on the app. Hopefully in the future, putting these features in will be a breeze after the course!
